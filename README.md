# ContactFormBundle

ContactFormBundle does the following:

- Display a form to contact a website,
- Pre-fills data if user is logged in,
- Dispatch events to modify form/email,
- Sends the email via mailer,
- Allows the possibility to send email to other user, related to your app specification, i.e. contact another user without giving its email. This is achieved via event dispatch (see below),
- Provides honeypot and delay before real submission, to avoid spam and not need to request captcha (see below),

## Bundle installation

### Step 1: Download the Bundle

v5.x works with Symfony 6.x. **Use v3|4.x for Symfony 4.x** **Use v2.x for Symfony 3.x**
Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install the library

```bash
    composer require c975l/contactform-bundle
```

### Step 2: Configure the Bundle

Check dependencies for their configuration:

c975LContactFormBundle uses [c975L/ConfigBundle](https://github.com/975L/ConfigBundle) to manage configuration parameters. Use the Route "/contact/config" with the proper user role to modify them.

### Step 3: Declaration of Twig\Extensions\TextExtension

You have to allow `Twig\Extensions\TextExtension` in your `/config/pacakes/twig_extensions.yaml`.

### Step 4: Enable the Routes

Then, enable the routes by adding them to the `/config/routes.yaml` file of your project:

```yml
c975_l_contact_form:
    resource: "@c975LContactFormBundle/Controller/"
    type:     annotation
    prefix:   /
    #Multilingual website use the following
    #prefix: /{_locale}
    #defaults:   { _locale: '%locale%' }
    #requirements:
    #    _locale: en|fr|es
```

### Step 5: Override templates

It is strongly recommended to use the [Override Templates from Third-Party Bundles feature](http://symfony.com/doc/current/templating/overriding.html) to integrate fully with your site.

For this, simply, create the following structure `/templates/bundles/c975LContactFormBundle/` in your app and then duplicate the file `layout.html.twig` in it, to override the existing Bundle file.

In `layout.html.twig`, it will mainly consist to extend your layout and define specific variables, i.e. :

```twig
{% extends 'layout.html.twig' %}

{# Defines specific variables #}
{% set title = 'Contact' %}

{% block content %}
    {% block contactform_content %}
    {% endblock %}
{% endblock %}
```

The template used for sending emails is the one of c975LSiteBundle. Override it in `/templates/c975LSiteBundle/emails/layout.html.twig`.

### How to use

The Route name is `contactform_display` so you can add link in Twig via Ì€`{{ path('contactform_display') }}`.

The url path is `/contact` or `/{_locale}/contact`, so simply access to `http://example.com/contact` or `http://example.com/en/contact` to display the form.

You can set the subject by using the url parameter `s` i.e. `http://example.com/contact?s=Subject`, the field will be readonly in the form, **but, of course it can be changed via the url**. The value is sanitized and given (as `subject`) to the form in order to be able to change title and/or info text based on this value, i.e.

```twig
{% if 'Subject' in subject %}
    {# Do some stuff #}
{% endif %}
```

### HoneyPot and delay to avoid spam

To avoid ContactFormBundle serving as an entry point to send spam, the field `username` is a honeypot. It's only displayed to robots and is hidden via css to normal users. If it's filled, then it's not a user, but a bot. There is also a test for the delay used to submit the form. If the form is submitted before the defined delay then it may has not been filled by a human.

For both cases, ContactFormBundle will act as if the mail was sent, but it will not be the case.

**Please note** that if you have disabled `unsafe-inline` for `style-src` in your Content Security Policy, you have to add the following code in your stylesheet css file. If you use [SiteBundle](https://github.com/975L/SiteBundle), it's already included.

```css
label[for=contact_form_username],
#contact_form_username {
    position:absolute;
    top:-1000px;
    left:-1000px;
    display:none
}
```

### Changing infoText

You can change the text displayed at the top of the Contact Form with the following code in your overriding template `/templates/c975LContactFormBundle/layout.html.twig`:

```twig
{% extends 'layout.html.twig' %}

{% set infoText = 'text.contact_info'|trans({'%site%': site}, 'contactForm') %}

{% if YOUR_CONDITION_IS_MET %}
    {% set infoText = 'YOUR_TEXT_TO_DISPLAY' %}
{% endif %}

{% block content %}
    {% block contactform_content %}
    {% endblock %}
{% endblock %}
```

## Events dispatch

### Disable "Receive copy" checkbox

You can disable the checkbox to allow user receiving a copy of the email sent, by catching the event `CREATE_FORM` with the following code. It's useful, for example if the contact form is used to contact another user and you want to preserve its email address.

```php
namespace AppBundle\EventSubscriber;

use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
use c975L\ContactFormBundle\Event\ContactFormEvent;

class ContactFormSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return array(
            ContactFormEvent::CREATE_FORM => 'createForm',
        );
    }

    public function createForm($event)
    {
        //Gets data
        $formData = $event->getFormData();
        $subject = $formData->getSubject();

        //For example, you can check if a string is present in the subject
        if (stripos($subject, 'THE_STRING_YOU_WANT_TO_MATCH_IN_THE_SUBJECT') === 0) {
            $event->setReceiveCopy(false);
        }
    }
}
```

### Set specific data in email sent

In relation with your app specification, it is possible to set specific email data (body, subject, etc.) based on the data sent in form. For this you have to create a listener with the following code:

```php
namespace AppBundle\EventSubscriber;

use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
use c975L\ContactFormBundle\Event\ContactFormEvent;

class ContactFormSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return array(
            ContactFormEvent::SEND_FORM => 'sendForm',
        );
    }

    public function sendForm($event)
    {
        //Gets data
        $formData = $event->getFormData();
        $subject = $formData->getSubject();

        //For example, you can check if a string is present in the subject
        if (stripos($subject, 'THE_STRING_YOU_WANT_TO_MATCH_IN_THE_SUBJECT') === 0) {
            //Do the stuff...

            //Conditions to send email are met
            if (1 == 1) {
                //Defines data for email
                $bodyEmail = 'YOUR_EMAIL_TEMPLATE.html.twig';
                $bodyData = array(
                     //Any needed data for your template
                );
                //The following array keys are mandatory, but you can set the other keys defined in c975L\EmailBundle
                $emailData = array(
                    'subject' => 'YOUR_EMAIL_SUBJECT',
                    'bodyData' => $bodyData,
                    'bodyEmail' => $bodyEmail,
                );

                //Updates event
                $event->setEmailData($emailData);
            //Stop sending by setting an error code, it will create a flash including your error code
            } else {
                $event->setError('YOUR_ERROR_CODE');
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Update redirect url

You can update the url to be redirected to, after submission of the form, with the following code:

```php
namespace AppBundle\EventSubscriber;

use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
use c975L\ContactFormBundle\Event\ContactFormEvent;

class ContactFormSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return array(
            ContactFormEvent::CREATE_FORM => 'createForm',
        );
    }

    public function createForm($event)
    {
        //Updates url to redirect
        $event->getRequest()->getSession()->set('redirectUrl', 'https://example.com');
    }
}
```
